# Automatisch Railway Deployment Notes

## üîÑ Future Enhancement: Pull App Setup

### Overview

Consider setting up the [Pull app](https://wei.github.io/pull/) to keep this fork synchronized with upstream Automatisch changes.

### Current Status

- ‚úÖ Fork is set up and working with Railway deployment
- ‚úÖ Custom Railway configuration files added (railway.json, nixpacks.toml, package.json)
- ‚è≥ Pull app setup deferred to avoid conflicts with deployment configuration

### Why We're Waiting

1. **Custom Changes**: Added Railway-specific configuration files that would be overwritten by hard reset
2. **Deployment Stability**: Current setup is working; don't want to introduce instability
3. **Manual Control**: Need to preserve Railway deployment configuration

### When to Revisit

- [ ] Railway deployment is fully stable and tested
- [ ] Understand maintenance needs and update frequency
- [ ] Have a strategy for handling conflicts with Railway config files

### Potential Configuration (if implemented later)

```yaml
version: "1"
rules:
  - base: master
    upstream: automatisch:master
    mergeMethod: merge # Use merge instead of hardreset to preserve changes
    mergeUnstable: true
```
