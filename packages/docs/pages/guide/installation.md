# Installation

:::info
We have installation guides for docker compose and docker setup at the moment, but if you need another installation type, let us know by [creating a GitHub issue](https://github.com/automatisch/automatisch/issues/new).
:::

:::tip

You can use `user@automatisch.io` email address and `sample` password to login to Automatisch. Please do not forget to change your email and password from the settings page.

:::

:::danger
Please be careful with the `ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY` environment variables. They are used to encrypt your credentials from third-party services and verify webhook requests. If you change them, your existing connections and flows will not continue to work.
:::

## Docker Compose

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:automatisch/automatisch.git

# Go to the repository folder
cd automatisch

# Start
docker compose up
```

✌️ That's it; you have Automatisch running. Let's check it out by browsing [http://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000)

### Upgrade with Docker Compose

If you want to upgrade the Automatisch version with docker compose, first you need to pull the main branch of Automatisch repository.

```bash
git pull origin main
```

Then you can run the following command to rebuild the containers with the new images.

```bash
docker compose up --force-recreate --build
```

## Docker

Automatisch comes with two services which are `main` and `worker`. They both use the same image and need to have the same environment variables except for the `WORKER` environment variable which is set to `true` for the worker service.

::: warning
We give the sample environment variable files for the setup but you should adjust them to include your own values.
:::

To run the main:

```bash
docker run --env-file=./.env automatischio/automatisch
```

To run the worker:

```bash
docker run --env-file=./.env -e WORKER=true automatischio/automatisch
```

::: details .env

```bash
APP_ENV=production
